    "Lyell’s offprint collection held at the University of Edinburgh extends to 22 bound volumes (A5 in size), and 30 archival boxes arranged A-Z into 2 series (A5 and A4 size documents). An offprint is a separate printing of a work that originally appeared as part of a larger publication, usually one of composite authorship such as an academic journal, magazine, or edited book. They are used by authors to promote their work, and so they are often given away, bearing an inscription from the author. This exchange of offprints can be then viewed as correspondence between scholars – and mention of the exchange between Lyell and different authors is noted in his notebooks and in the correspondence series. Additionally, the series of sixteen {Index Books (reference Coll-203/ A5 dated 1855 – 1871):'https://archives.collections.ed.ac.uk/repositories/2/archival_objects/203411'} appear to relate to the series of 22 bound offprints. These Index Books contain Lyell’s reflections, quotations, and questions, offering insight into his reading and his engagement with the papers.",
    "During 2024 University of Edinburgh student interns Claire Bottoms and Harriet Mack, supported by funding from The Friends of Edinburgh University Library, created a box list of Lyell’s offprints. These lists are available on request by emailing {HeritageCollections@ed.ac.uk:'mailto:HeritageCollections@ed.ac.uk'}.",
    "Please note that some of the offprints are waiting to be tested for hazardous pigments and you may be required to follow specific health and safety procedures in order to view them. If this is the case you will be provided with instructions and PPE in the Centre for Research Collections Reading Room."
